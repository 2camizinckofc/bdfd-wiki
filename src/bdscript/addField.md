# $addField
Adds a field to the embed.

## Usage
```
$addField[name;value;(optional) inline (yes/no)]
```

### Breakdown
- `name` - The name of the field.
- `value` - The value of the field.
- `inline` - If 'yes', fields will appear in same line. However, if you have more than 3 fields (or the fields are just too long) with inline enabled, the bot will return rows with 3 fields (2 if there is a thumbnail) in each row. 'no' by default. Optional.
> üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Inline fields may not appear inline on some mobile devices.
