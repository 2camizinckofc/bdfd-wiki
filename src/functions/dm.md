# $dm
There are three possible usages of the `$dm` command

The first is:
```php
$dm
```
This will send the message to the user that runs the command.

The second is:
```php
$dm[]
```
This will send the message to the first mentioned user.

The third is:
```php
$dm[User ID;...]
```
This will send the message to every user with given User ID.

If the command fails to send the message, make sure the user
allows dm messages from anyone.  \
